Building a personal computer can take around 2-3 hours for someone unfamiliar with tech stuff. Here's a simple guide to help you:

1. **Prepare the Components**: Lay out all the parts - motherboard, CPU, RAM, GPU, storage, power supply, case, etc. Make sure you have all the necessary components.

2. **Read the Manuals**: Each component comes with a manual. Take some time to read through them. They provide step-by-step instructions specific to that part.

3. **Assemble the Motherboard**: Start by installing the CPU, then the RAM, and finally the GPU if it's not integrated. Connect the power supply, fans, and any other cables.

4. **Install the Motherboard**: Place the motherboard in the case and secure it with screws. Connect the case cables to the motherboard (power button, USB ports, etc.).

5. **Add Other Components**: Install the storage devices (SSD/HDD) and connect them to the motherboard. Install any additional cards like Wi-Fi or sound cards.

6. **Cable Management**: Organize the cables inside the case to improve airflow and aesthetics. Use zip ties to keep them tidy.

7. **Power Up**: Connect the power supply to the motherboard and other components. Double-check all connections. Press the power button and see if it boots up.

8. **Install Operating System**: If everything is working, you can install your preferred operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) using a USB drive.

9. **Updates and Drivers**: After installing the OS, make sure to update it and install the necessary drivers for your components. This ensures everything runs smoothly.

10. **Enjoy Your New PC**: Once everything is set up, you can start using your new personal computer for work, gaming, or any other tasks you have in mind.

Remember, take your time, follow the instructions carefully, and don't rush the process. Building a PC can be a fun and rewarding experience, even for beginners.
