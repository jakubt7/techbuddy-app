A CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. It is like the brain of a computer. The CPU is responsible for carrying out instructions from programs and performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations specified by those instructions. In simpler terms, the CPU is the component in a computer that processes data and performs calculations.

Tips:
1. The CPU is often referred to as the processor.
2. The speed of a CPU is measured in gigahertz (GHz) and determines how quickly it can process data.
3. CPUs can have multiple cores, which allow them to perform tasks more efficiently by handling multiple processes simultaneously.
4. When choosing a computer or laptop, consider the CPU's performance to ensure it meets your needs for speed and multitasking.
